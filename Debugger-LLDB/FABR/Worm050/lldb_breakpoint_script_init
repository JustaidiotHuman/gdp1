# Note:
# By default, the LLDB command "breakpoint command add" attaches the command to the breakpoint
# that was defined most recently.
# Here, it attaches to the breakpoint at function 'readUserInput'
# If you like to attach the command to some other breakpoint you need to
# provide the breakpoint id as an addtional argument.

breakpoint command add --python-function lldb_breakpoint_script_worm050.breakpoint_callback --script-type python

# Release process from stop due to attach command.
# Note: you probably have to press some key in the worm window as well.
